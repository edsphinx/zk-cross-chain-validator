# zk-Cross-Chain Validator MVP

A proof-of-concept project that demonstrates secure, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective cross-chain validation using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) on Layer 2. This MVP is built with a modular architecture to enable future expansion of data input use cases.

## Overview

The zk-Cross-Chain Validator MVP is designed to validate blockchain data off-chain via zk circuits and verify it on-chain through a Solidity verifier deployed on a Layer 2 testnet (e.g., Scroll Testnet). The system is modular, allowing additional data input types to be integrated later.

## Data Input Use Cases

The MVP supports five prioritized use cases, each implemented as its own zk circuit to validate specific data conditions:

1. **Account Balance Verification**  
   _Objective:_ Prove that an account's balance exceeds a predefined threshold.  
   _Input:_ Account address, reported balance, threshold value.  
   _Relevance:_ Ensures eligibility for DeFi applications (e.g., staking or lending).

2. **Asset Ownership Confirmation**  
   _Objective:_ Confirm ownership of a specific token or NFT.  
   _Input:_ Account address, asset identifier (token ID/contract address), proof data.  
   _Relevance:_ Supports cross-chain asset bridging and NFT validation.

3. **Transaction Existence Proof**  
   _Objective:_ Prove that a particular transaction occurred on a source chain.  
   _Input:_ Transaction hash, block data, Merkle proof of inclusion.  
   _Relevance:_ Useful for audit trails and verifying cross-chain activity.

4. **Cross-Chain Voting Eligibility**  
   _Objective:_ Validate that a user meets criteria (e.g., minimum stake) for governance participation.  
   _Input:_ Account address, voting threshold, current stake/balance.  
   _Relevance:_ Enables secure and private cross-chain voting mechanisms.

5. **Collateral Verification for Lending**  
   _Objective:_ Prove that a user holds sufficient collateral for a lending protocol.  
   _Input:_ Account address, collateral asset details, collateral amount, required minimum.  
   _Relevance:_ Facilitates risk management in cross-chain DeFi lending.

Each use case is isolated in its own circuit, enabling independent development and future expansion.

## Technical Architecture

### Off-Chain Component

- **zk Circuits:** Developed in Circom (or Noir). Each circuit validates one of the five use cases.
- **Proof Generation:** Utilize `circom` and `snarkjs` to compile circuits, generate witnesses, and produce zk proofs.
- **Modularity:** The design allows additional circuits to be integrated without impacting existing ones.

### On-Chain Component

- **Verifier Contract:** A Solidity contract (developed and tested with Foundry) that accepts zk proofs and public inputs, verifying them on-chain.
- **Extensible Interface:** Designed to support multiple data input types via modular functions.

### Integration Scripts

- **Automation:** Node.js scripts (using Ethers.js) that tie the off-chain proof generation and on-chain verification into a seamless pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- **Software:** Node.js (v14+), Foundry, Circom, snarkjs
- **Environment:** Access to a Layer 2 testnet (e.g., Scroll Testnet)
- **Expertise:** Familiarity with zero-knowledge proofs, Solidity (v0.8.x), and JavaScript

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edsphinx/zk-cross-chain-validator.git
   cd zk-cross-chain-validator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Circom and snarkjs:**
   Follow the [Circom installation guide](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/) to install Circom and snarkjs globally.

## Usage

### Off-Chain Proof Generation

For each use case, compile the corresponding zk circuit. For example, for Account Balance Verification:

1. **Compile the Circuit:**

   ```bash
   circom circuits/AccountBalanceProof.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
   ```

2. **Generate the Witness and Proof:**

   ```bash
   node circuits/AccountBalanceProof_js/generate_witness.js circuits/AccountBalanceProof_js/AccountBalanceProof.wasm input.json witness.wtns
   snarkjs groth16 prove circuits/AccountBalanceProof.r1cs pot12_final.ptau witness.wtns proof.json public.json
   ```

   Repeat similar steps for the other circuits.

### On-Chain Verification

1. **Deploy the Verifier Contract:**
   Use Foundry to deploy the contract on Scroll Testnet:

   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployVerifier.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
   ```

2. **Verify the Proof:**
   Run the integration script to submit the proof and public inputs:

   ```bash
   node scripts/verifyProof.js --contract <deployed_address> --proof proof.json --public public.json
   ```

### Testing

Run unit tests using Foundry:

```bash
forge test
```

## Future Roadmap

With additional support, the project will evolve as follows:

1. **Advanced Proof Aggregation:**
   Aggregate multiple zk proofs into a single succinct proof to lower on-chain verification costs.

2. **Universal zk Verifier (WASM-Based):**
   Develop a WASM-based verifier for chain-agnostic proof validation.

3. **Expanded Data Input Modules:**
   Integrate additional modular circuits for new use cases (e.g., dynamic collateral adjustment, multi-token verification).

4. **User Interface Development:**
   Build a dashboard for users to generate proofs, submit verifications, and monitor status.

5. **Enhanced Security & Scalability:**
   Conduct comprehensive audits and optimize the system for production deployment.
