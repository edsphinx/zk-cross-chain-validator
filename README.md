# zk-cross-chain-validator
zk-Cross-Chain Validator MVP aims to deliver secure, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective cross-chain interoperability using zero-knowledge proofs. It validates blockchain data off-chain via zk-SNARKs and on-chain via smart contracts, laying the foundation for scalable, trustless multi-chain solutions.
